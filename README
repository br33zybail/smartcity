# Nashville Smart City OS MVP

Proof-of-concept autonomous smart city monitoring system focused on Nashville, TN.  
Designed as **nationwide-scalable** microservices architecture from day one.

**Core Principle**: Right tool for the right job — demonstrating deliberate architecture choices.

### Tech Stack & Responsibilities
- **Go** (gateway): High-concurrency orchestrator, API gateway, WebSocket real-time updates, job queue
- **Rust** (processor): Blazing-fast filtering, geospatial calculations, gatekeeping before expensive AI calls
- **Python** (ai-agent): LLM agents (OpenAI/Claude), RAG pipelines, anomaly reasoning, Text-to-SQL
- **TypeScript/Next.js** (frontend): Interactive Mapbox/Leaflet dashboard + natural language query interface
